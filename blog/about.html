<p>Passionate software developer, who loves solving problems and build software that helps people and companies. From the moment I learned how to program, I would always study different technologies at home than at work or at school, enjoying the challenge and trying to stay ahead of the curve. For a long time that was ruby, these days it’s with haskell and lisp-based languages. I also played with OpenGL, my raspberry pi and wrote various android apps for my phone through time. I also like to think I’m a good team player, whether in cooperation with my peers, or mentoring of junior developers.</p>
<p>I have a strong experience in communicating with customers, preparing specifications, leading projects to their completion and supporting them.</p>

<p>LIT Transit (Ljubljana, Slovenia) develops public transit solutions for customers around the world. I got to cooperate in particular with customers in Singapore. I was responsible for the writing of specifications, work effort estimates, implementation and supervision of some other team members. I participated in the implementation and maintenance of several bigger software projects and also multiple side-projects. My main area of expertise is the backend, but I did implement several important android projects and do a fair amount of frontend work.</p>

<p>Regulussoft (Ljubljana, Slovenia) is a smaller software development company developing solutions for third parties. I had the opportunity to work with numerous customers and technologies through the years. My experience mixed longer, multi-year, projects, with shorter multi-month ones. In a smaller company, I could develop my self-initiative and flexibility. I could also get exposition to many different technologies through that time (windows CE, symbian, palm, android, windows, linux, java, .NET, even a bit PHP, and so on).</p>

<h3 id="masters-of-science-national-university-of-ireland-maynooth-2001">Masters of Science, National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2001)</h3>
<p>Final year of studies in Ireland through the ERASMUS student exchange program. Obtained a MSc from Maynooth as well as the engineering degree from Telecom Nancy.</p>
<h3 id="software-engineer-telecom-nancy-france-1999-2001">Software engineer, Telecom Nancy, France (1999-2001)</h3>
<p>Software engineering school in three years (admission after two years of Higher School Preparatory Classes in France). Last year through the ERASMUS programme. Gave me a solid theoretical and practical base on the technical side, together with a preparation to practical enterprise work. The second year internship was in the LORIA research institution.</p>

<h2 id="oss-projects-ive-written-or-contributed-to">OSS projects I’ve written or contributed to</h2>
<p>I’ve authored or contributed to a series of OSS projects, mostly in <span class="tech-tag">haskell</span>, <span class="tech-tag">typescript</span>, and <span class="tech-tag">java</span>.</p>
<h3 id="functional-programming">Functional programming</h3>
<p>I’m the author of <a href="https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/prelude-ts">prelude-ts</a>, which is a typescript library aiming to make functional programming concepts accessible and productive in typescript. It provides immutable &amp; persistent collections such as a vector, set and map, and functional control constructs like option/maybe and either.</p>
<p>I have made <a href="https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/commits?author=emmanueltouzery">significant contributions</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr">vavr</a> java project, which is an object-functional language extension to Java 8.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-interoperability">Parsing &amp; Interoperability</h3>
<p>I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/hsexif">hsexif</a>, a haskell library which parses EXIF information from JPEG and RAW files.</p>
<p>I have made <a href="https://github.com/jpvillaisaza/slack-web/commits?author=emmanueltouzery">significant contributions</a> to and am co-maintaining <a href="https://github.com/jpvillaisaza/slack-web">slack-web</a>, which is a modern haskell library offering bindings to the <a href="http://www.slack.com">slack team messaging</a> web API.</p>
<h3 id="angular-type-checking">Angular type-checking</h3>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/ng-typeview">ng-typeview</a>, which enables type-checking of angular1 views when you use typescript with angularjs. ng-typeview parses HTML views and javascript/typescript controllers and directives, and enables type-checking of the views against your typescript.</p>
<h3 id="gui-applications">GUI applications</h3>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/projectpad">projectpad</a>, a haskell application using QML for its GUI and <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher</a>, a SQLite extension offering encryption for data storage, to manage secret credentials and server information.</p>
<p>I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/cigale-timesheet">cigale-timesheet</a>, which is a haskell application using <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex">reflex</a> for its GUI. That application collects data from various sources (source control, chats, emails, calendar, bugtracking software) to help the user prepare a timesheet of the tasks he or she has been performing.</p>
